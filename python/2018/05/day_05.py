2018, Day 5: Alchemical Reduction

You've managed to sneak in to the prototype suit manufacturing lab. The Elves
are making decent progress, but are still struggling with the suit's size
reduction capabilities.

While the very latest in 1518 alchemical technology might have solved their
problem eventually, you can do better. You scan the chemical composition of the
suit's material and discover that it is formed by extremely long polymers (one
of which is available as your puzzle input).

The polymer is formed by smaller units which, when triggered, react with each
other such that two adjacent units of the same type and opposite polarity are
destroyed. Units' types are represented by letters; units' polarity is
represented by capitalization. For instance, r and R are units with the same
type but opposite polarity, whereas r and s are entirely different types and do
not react.

    How many units remain after fully reacting the polymer you scanned?

    part 2 (MemoryError).
